<h1>About the Director</h1>
<p>I met Mayomi while working in Sri Lanka for Oxfam, and built up a trusting relationship with her. I was immediately struck by her quiet stoicism amid the uncertainly of her life. She was left holding her family together yet had no voice within her family and the community.</p>

<p>My objective was to make a carefully observed film that gradually unfolds, concentrating on the small moments, that reveals the complexities of this women&acute;s life. It was filmed over an 18 months period.
</p>
<p>
After working at the BBC, I studied editing at the National Film and Television School. Since then, I have been able to combine my passion for editing, working as a freelance editor on various shorts, features, television dramas and documentaries, with making my own films.
